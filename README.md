# Computer-Vision-Projects
This repository is a series of Computer Vision Projects merged from different tutorials articles or videos.
The goal is to use the latest version of YOLOv8 to perform different kind of tasks.

# Project 1 - CCTV Vehicle Counter and Speed Limiter
This project aim to count the different kind of vehicle present in a traffic (moto, bus, truck or cars) and also determining the speed of each vehicle.

# Project 3 - COCO dataset YOLO object detection
This project aim to analyse all the 80 default classes trained by YOLOv8

# Project 4 - ROMIE detecting mining workers
This project was built for a part of the vision recognition for the autonomous software pipeline of ROMIE
ROMIE is now able to detect the staff around him and determine if they are wearing or NOT:
	- protective helmet
	- protective mask
	- construction flashy jacket
