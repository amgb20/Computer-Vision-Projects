# Computer-Vision-Projects
This repository is a series of Computer Vision Projects merged from different tutorials articles or videos.
The goal is to use the latest version of YOLOv8 to perform different kind of tasks.

## Project 1 - CCTV Vehicle Counter and Speed Limiter
This project aims to count the different types of vehicles present in traffic (motorcycle, bus, truck, or cars) and also determine the speed of each vehicle.

# Project 3 - COCO dataset YOLO object detection
This project aim to analyse all the 80 default classes trained by YOLOv8

# Project 4 - ROMIE detecting mining workers
This project was built for a part of the vision recognition for the autonomous software pipeline of ROMIE
ROMIE is now able to detect the staff around him and determine if they are wearing or NOT:
	- protective helmet
	- protective mask
	- construction flashy jacket
